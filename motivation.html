                    <p>All your life you are told the things you cannot do. All your life they will say you’re not good enough or strong enough or talented enough; they will say you’re the wrong height or the wrong weight or the wrong type to play this or be this or achieve this. THEY WILL TELL YOU NO, a thousand times no, until all the no’s become meaningless. All your life they will tell you no, quite firmly and very quickly. AND YOU WILL TELL THEM YES.</p>

                    <p>Sport is not a logical proposition. It thrives on obsession, passion, and going beyond what you thought was possible. If you have a body, you are an athlete.</p>
